# Phi-2 Fine-tuning with QLoRA

## Overview

This repository contains code and instructions for fine-tuning Microsoft's Phi-2 language model using the PEFT (Pseudo-Elastic Flow Transformer) library, with a focus on Quality Language Representation Adaptation (QLoRA). The QLoRA adaptation is performed to enhance the model's understanding of meaning representations in natural language.

## Background

The Phi-2 model is a powerful language model developed by Microsoft, and this repository demonstrates how to fine-tune it for specific tasks using the PEFT library. QLoRA is employed to adapt the model to generate more accurate and contextually relevant meaning representations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the fine-tuning process:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt`.
3. Set up the training data and adjust parameters in the provided Jupyter notebook (`phi2_finetune.ipynb`).

## Training

The training process involves configuring the model, setting hyperparameters, and monitoring convergence. Key steps include:

- Defining the base model (Phi-2) and QLoRA adapter.
- Configuring the training parameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and max steps.
- Monitoring convergence and adjusting training duration based on performance.

Refer to the `phi2_finetune.ipynb` notebook for detailed instructions and code snippets.

## Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance using specific prompts or input sentences. The provided notebook includes an example of evaluating the fine-tuned model on a target sentence and examining the generated meaning representation.

## Results

The results section provides insights into the performance of the fine-tuned Phi-2 model. It includes examples of generated meaning representations and discusses the impact of different training durations.
